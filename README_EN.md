### Profile
I am a multifaceted engineer with a strong background in computer science and a forward-thinking approach to product architecture, driven by the belief that the best products arise from the convergence of technical depth and human-centric empathy.

My mental models are shaped by extensive and interdisciplinary systematic reading (over 3300 hours and 863 books since 2019), which has allowed me to build a "T-shaped" knowledge structure with depth in computer science and breadth in the humanities and social sciences. This enables me to understand technology from first principles and, more importantly, to grasp the essence of user and business needs to find innovative solutions to complex problems.

I am eager to join a top-tier team where I can combine my passion for technology, curiosity for products, and interdisciplinary thinking to create products that deliver immense value to users and society.
