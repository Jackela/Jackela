# Weixuan Kong (Â≠îÁª¥ËΩ©) - T-Shaped Thinker | AI Product Builder

> I am a committed "First-Principles" thinker with a solid computer science foundation and forward-looking product architecture mindset. My mental model has benefited from long-term, interdisciplinary systematic reading. Since 2019, I have invested over 3,300 hours reading 863 books, building a "T-shaped knowledge structure" with computer science as depth and humanities and social sciences as breadth.
> 
> This structure has been deeply inspired by management thinkers like **Clayton Christensen**, **Joseph Schumpeter**, and **Geoffrey Moore**. I firmly believe that for our generation of engineers, true opportunities lie not in simply optimizing existing markets (sustaining innovation), but in understanding technology as an engine of "creative destruction"‚Äîbuilding new, simpler, and more accessible value networks (**disruptive innovation**) for the silent majority overlooked by mature technology stacks, and helping excellent products successfully **"cross the chasm"**.
> 
> All my personal projects are clumsy but sincere explorations of this belief.

### Core Methodology: First-Principles Thinking

The starting point of all my product work is returning to the essence of "First-Principles" thinking. In the AI product field, I've discovered that applying this mindset thoroughly naturally produces what I personally call a **"Systemic Empathy"** practice framework:

To return to the first principle of "user value," I must simultaneously empathize with the three core systems that support this value:

*   **Technical System Empathy:** Respecting the vitality of architecture, treating code as a long-term asset. I pursue not only functional implementation but also system simplicity, scalability, and maintainability, taking responsibility for the system's long-term health.
*   **Business System Empathy:** Understanding that technical decisions ultimately serve business objectives. I pursue clear, quantifiable results, driving growth, reducing costs, or creating strategic advantages through technical means, being responsible for business success.
*   **User System Empathy:** Deeply exploring the 'first principles' of user problems rather than staying at surface requirements. I believe that the deepest empathy for users will ultimately be reflected through an elegant, reliable, and easy-to-use product architecture.

### Intellectual Cornerstones

The following books have profoundly influenced my "T-shaped knowledge structure," shaping my views on innovation, systems, and decision-making:

*   **"The Innovator's Dilemma"** - *Clayton Christensen*
*   **"Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy"** - *Joseph Schumpeter*
*   **"Crossing the Chasm"** - *Geoffrey Moore*
*   **"Thinking in Systems"** - *Donella H. Meadows*

### üìö Exploration & Practice

I am dedicated to putting theoretical thinking into practice. All my projects revolve around one core question: How to build elegant, reliable, and evolvable technical systems for "non-consumers" and "new markets."
